### Pipeline Demo

The idea was to show how we can wrap an existing analytical pipeline within a workflow engine and API to provide a variety of interfaces that users can access, including:

* uploading sensor data to a web interface
* uploading sensor data files programatically in a way that can be automated
* selecting data and opening a terminal, IDE, or notebook to develop new extraction algorithms.

We are currently working on documenting what we have developed so far with an aim at helping end users use the system. I will put your questions on GitHub to make sure that they are addressed in the documentation. 

* links to existing code, documentation

1) ' how can I test this system out? Is the pipeline already set up with some of the PlantCV tools?'

What I showed was a minimal demonstration, and the team and I are currently writing out what we showed. I showed four ways of executing the PlantCV pipeline: 

1. uploading a file triggers the pipeline. Here is an example of the finished product: http://141.142.208.144/clowder/files/5643baa8e4b086fa6db916ca
2. launching a Jupyter notebook, then the analysis can be done at the bash shell.
