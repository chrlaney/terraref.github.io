# Background and Objectives

NCSA will design and implement a data storage and computing pipeline that will extract information from plants that can be used to predict potential yield from thousands of genotypes in field trials.

The overall program goal is to transform plant breeding through 'advanced phenotyping'. The improvements of crops is based on phenotypes - this are measurable features of the plant that are indicative of performance (e.g. potential yield, stress resistance). Breeding is currently limited by the speed at which phenotypes can be measured, and the information that can be extracted from these measurements. Currently, measurements used to predict yield include measuring leaf thickness with a caliper or height with a meter stick. More sophisticated instruments used to quantify plant architecture, carbon uptake, water use, and root growth do not scale to the thousands or tens of thousands of individual plants that need to be evaluated in a breeding program.

## Data Storage and Computing Pipeline

We will develop a data storage and computing system that provides researchers with access to all of the 'raw' data and derived plant phenotypes (traits). 
Most of the data volume will come from a [Lemnatec Scanalyzer Field System](http://www.lemnatec.com/products/hardware-solutions/scanalyzer-field/) platform in Arizona, and will be accompanied by data from aerial, ground, and tractor-based field sensors. 
Danforth has an indoor phenotyping system - automated sensing of plants in boxes. At the USDA research station in Maricopa, AZ a Lemnatec field platform will be installed over a field of sorghum and run for four years. This will be complimented by an indoor system for automated sensing of plants in boxes.

## (Draft, out of date) Milestones

* Demonstrate software integration, data transfer from the field, data reduction, refinement and processing for model integration
* Develop data registration algorithms
* Validate processes for feature extraction from field images and association with individual plants
* Form reference data committee
* Create file standards and sample data sets
